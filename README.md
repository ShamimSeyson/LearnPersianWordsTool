# LearnPersianWordsTool
A simple tool to learn Persian (Farsi) words or short phrases and sentences for beginners learning to read and write, in the same vein as Duolingo. In this tool, learners are tested or quizzed by a random prompt word or phrase from a set of some 600. They can attempt to sound it out and read it, check their answer, and go to another one infinitely.
